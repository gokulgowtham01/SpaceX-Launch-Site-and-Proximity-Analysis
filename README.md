# SpaceX-Launch-Site-and-Proximity-Analysis

This project uses Python and Folium to visualize SpaceX launch sites and calculate distances to nearby coastlines and points of interest. It processes geographic data from SpaceX launches and displays key information on an interactive map.

## Project Overview:
Data: SpaceX launch data with coordinates of launch sites and classification of successful and failed launches.

## Tools Used:
folium for interactive mapping.
pandas for data manipulation.
Custom Python functions to calculate distances using the Haversine formula.

## Features:
Launch Site Mapping: Visualizes SpaceX launch sites and payload details.
Marker Clusters: Adds clustered markers for better visualization.
Distance Calculations: Computes and displays distances between launch sites and the nearest coastline or points of interest.
Interactive Features: Users can input coordinates of coastlines or points of interest to find the closest one to a launch site.

## How to Run:
Install dependencies: folium, pandas, sqlite3.
Load the dataset from the provided URL.
Run the script to visualize the launch sites and calculate distances.
View the results on an interactive map generated by folium.
